# glVM

It's a work in progress stack-based virtual machine :)

## TODO

~~Functioning machine that executes instructions, has stored data & labels~~

~~Push instruction to add item to stack~~

~~Integers + integer arithmetic~~

~~Floats + float arithmetic~~

~~Type promotion for int+float arithmetic~~

~~Strings + string concatenation~~

~~Conditionals + loops (jump structure of some sort, JE)~~

~~functions (call, jump, ret, call stack, fib test)~~

~~/program tests~~

~~/values tests~~

~~/frame tests~~

~~Disassembly for program~~

Bytecode file reading/execution (main executable)

Pimp out readme (instruction table, fib program, etc)

## Not Planned Currently, but Reasonable Extensions

Arrays + array operations

Booleans + boolean logic

Standard Library

etc
