It's a work in progress stack-based virtual machine :)

## TODO

~~Functioning machine that executes instructions, has stored data & labels~~

~~Push instruction to add item to stack~~

~~Integers + integer arithmetic~~

~~Floats + float arithmetic~~

~~Type promotion for int+float arithmetic~~

~~Strings + string concatenation~~

Conditionals + loops (jump structure of some sort)

functions (label functionality, get/set arg/ret, fib test)

Arrays + array operations?

Booleans + boolean logic?
